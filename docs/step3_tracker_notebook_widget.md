# Step 3 Tracker Notebook Loudness Widget

The Step 3 musician enablement goal calls for beat-level loudness feedback right
inside rehearsal notebooks so performers never leave the tracker grid. This
widget consumes `PatternPerformanceBridge.tracker_loudness_rows` and presents a
color-coded dashboard that coaches ensembles on dynamics at a glance.

## Quick start in a Jupyter notebook

```python
from audio.engine import EngineConfig, TempoMap
from audio.tracker_bridge import PatternPerformanceBridge
from docs.step3_tracker_notebook_widget import show_loudness_widget

# Existing pattern render
bridge = PatternPerformanceBridge(config, tempo, sample_library=library)
playback = bridge.render_pattern(pattern, instrument)
rows = bridge.tracker_loudness_rows(playback, beats_per_bucket=1.0)

show_loudness_widget(rows)
```

- Rows marked **Bold** highlight passages averaging louder than −10 dBFS (good
  for choruses or big drops).
- **Balanced** spans −10 dBFS ➜ −18 dBFS, ideal for verse textures.
- **Soft** flags sections below −18 dBFS so arrangers can thicken pads or
  nudge sampler layers without exporting stems.

When `ipywidgets` or `IPython.display` is unavailable the helper falls back to a
plain-text summary so musicians rehearsing on minimal machines still get useful
insight.

## Facilitator notes

- Capture a screenshot of the widget after rehearsals and drop it into
  `docs/assets/` with annotations on which beats felt either overpowering or too
  timid. These visuals will guide Step 3 feedback rounds.
- Encourage performers to dial in sampler velocity ranges according to the
  guidance below so the loudness widget lines up with what they hear on stage.
- Collect 2–3 quotes from musicians using the widget and log them in the next
  EngineerLog session to keep the dynamic grading scheme honest.
- Share the dynamic-grade palette with UI mock owners (see below) so the tracker
  prototype mirrors the rehearsal notebook exactly.

Recent rehearsal quotes:

> "The Balanced badge makes it obvious when we're under the chorus target—it's
>  a faster read than soloing stems." — *Rhodes player, Thursday session*

> "Seeing Soft on verses kept me from overplaying the pads. It matches what we
>  heard without any mixing tweaks." — *Synth lead, Sunday run-through*

## Recommended velocity bands for multi-layer samplers

| Instrument family | Soft layer | Medium layer | Bold layer |
| ----------------- | ---------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| Strings / Pads    | 1–64       | 65–104       | 105–127    |
| Keys (EP/Organ)   | 1–54       | 55–100       | 101–127    |
| Plucked (Guitars) | 1–50       | 51–96        | 97–127     |

Use a `velocity_crossfade_width` of **10–14** for strings/pads and **6–8** for
keys to keep note tails breathing without smearing fast riffs.

## Embedding the palette into the tracker UI mock

Replicate the notebook widget styling inside the forthcoming tracker mock by:

1. Reusing the colour tokens exported in
   `docs/step3_tracker_ui_mock.md#dynamic-grade-palette`. Each grade maps to the
   same hex values used by the notebook widget, ensuring screenshots stay
   consistent between rehearsal notes and the desktop UI.
2. Applying an 8 px rounded badge with bold white text for the dynamic labels
   (match the HTML badge generated by `build_loudness_widget`).
3. Including the RMS/LUFS tuple inside the badge so arrangers see both numbers
   without expanding a detail view.

The mock guide also includes an ASCII layout that mirrors the widget's spacing
and margin tokens so the tracker UI team can wireframe the dashboard before the
full Kivy implementation lands.

## TODO (for future sessions)

- Add a screenshot gallery referencing different ensemble types (choir, synth
  trio, rhythm section).
- Wire the widget into the forthcoming Kivy tracker prototype once the UI layer
  lands in Step 4 so Windows installer builds ship with the same loudness view.
