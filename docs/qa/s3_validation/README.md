# S3 Smoke Test Reports

This directory captures empirical latency observations when exercising the
`S3ProjectRepository` end-to-end. Store JSON and Markdown summaries generated by
`tools/run_s3_smoke_test.py` here so future engineers can review the health of
the deployment pipeline alongside other QA artifacts.

## Recommended Workflow

```bash
poetry run python tools/run_s3_smoke_test.py \
    --identifier staging-smoke \
    --summary-json docs/qa/s3_validation/staging_smoke.json \
    --summary-markdown docs/qa/s3_validation/staging_smoke.md \
    --bootstrap-bucket
```

- Use `--use-moto` when rehearsing locally without AWS credentials. The helper
  provisions an in-memory emulator so the smoke test can run offline while still
  producing comparable timing information.
- Provide `--endpoint-url` for custom S3-compatible deployments (e.g., MinIO or
  LocalStack) and pair it with `--bootstrap-bucket` to ensure the bucket exists
  before executing the workload.
- Archive results in this directory (or reference them from incident reports)
  whenever the persistence layer is tuned as part of the Step 2/Plan §8
  milestones.

Retaining these reports makes it easier to quantify improvements, detect
regressions, and coordinate rollout decisions with infrastructure engineers.
