# UI Capture Manifest

The Windows HiDPI tracker dashboard screenshot referenced in the Step 3 docs is
stored on the rehearsal NAS due to its 5K resolution. Pull
`windows_hidpi_tracker_dashboard.png` from
`Rehearsal NAS:/NagaKang/ui/2024-04-tracker-dashboard/` before updating release
notes. Keep the filename consistent so automated documentation links remain
stable.

`tracker_mixer_three_panel.svg` documents the Step 7 tracker column + mixer dock
layout with tutorial callouts. Update the vector file when KV prototypes change
the spacing ratio so Kivy contributors can compare new screenshots to the
source-controlled annotations.
