# Engineer Log

## Session Summary (Step 1 - Vision & Requirements)
- Reviewed comprehensive development plan and executed Step 1 deliverables.
- Authored product vision, target user personas, UX priorities, and functional/non-functional requirements. (Estimated completion: 100%)
- Drafted MVP-focused Product Requirements Document summary with objectives, success metrics, assumptions, and risk mitigations. (Estimated completion: 100%)
- Documented core UX flows for project creation, instrument design, mixing, and controller integration to guide future prototyping. (Estimated completion: 95%)
- Curated prioritized backlog of user stories with acceptance criteria aligned to Step 1 requirements. (Estimated completion: 95%)

## Outstanding TODOs / Next Session Goals
1. **Finalize UX Flow Artifacts (Remaining ~5%)**
   - Convert textual flows into wireframe sketches or diagram references once tooling decisions are made.
2. **Expand Accessibility Requirements**
   - Gather detailed accessibility guidelines (WCAG alignment) to incorporate into UX specs.
3. **Prepare for Step 2: System Architecture & Technology Choices**
   - Research candidate audio/DSP libraries (pyo, JUCE via Python bindings, Rust crates) and compare performance characteristics.
   - Outline threading model and real-time constraints for audio engine vs. GUI layer.
4. **Define Documentation Structure**
   - Establish docs/ directory index and style guide for future architecture and developer documentation.

## Notes
- No automated tests were available or run in this documentation-focused session.
- All deliverables stored under `docs/` for continuity with subsequent steps.
